      Moroccan couscous is a cherished national dish, known for its delicate
      steamed semolina grains topped with a colorful medley of vegetables and
      tender meat—often lamb or chicken. Slow-cooked with warm spices like
      cumin, turmeric, and ginger, it’s both hearty and aromatic. Traditionally
      served on Fridays and at family gatherings, couscous is more than a
      meal—it’s a celebration of Moroccan hospitality and culture.

      <li>
        Place a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium heat. Stir in cumin,
        ginger, cloves, cayenne, cardamom, coriander, and allspice; gently toast
        until fragrant, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in oil and onion, cook until
        softened. Stir in bell pepper and zucchini; cook for 5 minutes. Stir in
        raisins, salt, zest, and chickpeas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in chicken broth and orange juice; turn heat to high and bring to a
        boil. When the mixture is boiling, stir in couscous and remove from
        heat; cover, and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork, and fold in
        chopped mint.
