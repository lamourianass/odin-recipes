      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Tagine is a traditional Moroccan dish, slow-cooked to perfection in a
        conical clay pot that shares its name. Bursting with rich spices like
        cumin, saffron, cinnamon, and ginger, tagine combines tender meat or
        vegetables with dried fruits, olives, or preserved lemons for a sweet
        and savory balance. Whether it’s lamb with prunes, chicken with lemon,
        or a hearty vegetarian mix, each tagine is a fragrant, comforting stew
        that brings people together around the table.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large onions, peeled and sliced into rings</li>
        <li>2 pounds lamb meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes</li>
        <li>
          1 teaspoon ground cumin, coriander seed, ginger, cinnamon, black
          pepper
        </li>
        <li>4 pears - peeled, cored and cut into 1 1/2 inch chunks</li>
        <li>½ cup golden raisins</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion;
          cook and stir in the oil until soft. Add lamb meat to the pan; fry
          until just browned on the outside. Season with cumin, coriander,
          ginger, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Pour just enough water into the
          pot to cover the lamb.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the pot; simmer over low heat until lamb is tender and the
          mixture is stew-like, about 1 ½ to 2 hours. Remove lid a little after
          an hour if there appears to be too much liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add pears, golden raisins, and almonds to the stew; cook for another 5
          minutes or so, until the pears are soft.
        </li>
